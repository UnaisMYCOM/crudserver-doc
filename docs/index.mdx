# CRUD Server Documentation

## What is a CRUD Server?

A **CRUD Server** is a server-side application that allows users to create APIs using **YAML configuration files**.  
This approach is simple, easy to understand, and quick to implement—similar to writing **pseudo code** instead of complex backend logic.

Using YAML, developers can define:
- Data sources
- CRUD operations
- Validations
- Filters and parameters  

without writing traditional backend code for each API.

## Difference Between CRUD Server and Remote Server

| CRUD Server | Remote Server |
|------------|---------------|
| APIs are created using **YAML configuration files** | APIs are created by writing **SQL stored procedures** and then exposing them as APIs |
| **No UI required** | Comes with a **UI** |
| A **single server** can handle **multiple clients** | Requires **separate sub-servers or remote server profiles** per client database |
| One server can support **multiple applications** | Requires **separate sub-servers or profiles** for each application |
| **Easy to debug** | Debugging **takes more time** |
| **Fast server initialization** | Initialization **slows down** as jobs and profiles increase |

## What Is Missing in CRUD Server?

Some advanced features are still under development, such as:
- **Timer-based profiles**
- Scheduled or background job execution

These features are planned for future enhancements.

## Goal of the CRUD Server

The goal of the CRUD Server is clearly reflected in its name:

- Handle all **standard CRUD operations** directly within the CRUD Server
- Reduce dependency on complex backend logic
- Use a **Remote Server** only when **complex APIs or advanced SQL logic** are required

This hybrid approach keeps the system:
- Clean
- Scalable
- Easy to maintain
