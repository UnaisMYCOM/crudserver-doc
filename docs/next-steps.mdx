# How to Get Started with CRUD Server

The **CRUD Server** follows a structured folder hierarchy to make development, debugging, and maintenance easier.  
Here’s a detailed explanation using an example project **CLOUD ERP v2**, which relies entirely on CRUD Server.

---

## Step 1: Folder Structure Overview

The folder structure is designed to keep projects, modules, and clients organized.  
Each project resides under the `config/` folder of the CRUD Server.

### Example:

- **Crud Server/**
  - **config/**
    - **CLOUD ERP v2/**
      - **app/**
        - **app_config/** – Define all paths and main database connection
        - **clients/**
          - **clients.yaml** – Contains client IDs and database connection details
        - **js_scripts/** – JavaScript validations for processing
        - **log/** – Logging schemas for errors or actions
        - **modules/**
          - **accounts/** – Module structure like ERP apps (accounts, products, stock)
            - **documents/**
            - **schema/**
          - **product_management/**
            - **documents/**
            - **schema/**
        - **process/** – Background processes or tasks
        - **report_sys/** – Reports and analytics configurations
        - **app_config/**
        - **system.yaml** – Core system configuration
        - **server.crt** – Server SSL certificate
        - **server.key** – Server SSL key
        - **crudserver.exe** – Console application used to initialize and run the server
    - **Smart Inv 1.8/** – Another project following the same structure

---

## Step 2: Explanation of Key Folders and Files

- **app_config/**  
  Contains global configurations for the project, including paths and database connection settings.

- **clients/clients.yaml**  
  Defines all clients, their IDs, and database connection information.  
  CRUD Server uses this to connect to different client databases dynamically.

- **js_scripts/**  
  Holds JavaScript validation scripts used in CRUD operations. These scripts can handle data validation, transformation, or other processing tasks.

- **log/**  
  Contains logging schemas. All errors, system actions, or operations performed by CRUD Server are logged here.

- **modules/**  
  Organizes the application modules similar to ERP structure (e.g., accounts, products, stock).  
  Each module typically has:
  - **documents/** – Defines document structures and business logic  
  - **schema/** – Defines the database schema related to that module  

- **process/**  
  Holds scripts for background jobs or processes.

- **report_sys/**  
  Contains configuration for reports and analytics within the project.

- **server.crt & server.key**  
  SSL certificate and key for secure server communication.

- **system.yaml**  
  Core system configuration that defines global settings and behaviors of CRUD Server.

- **crudserver.exe**  
  Console application used to initialize and run the server. This is the main executable that starts the CRUD Server for the selected project and clients.

## Step 3: Understanding Project Hierarchy

Projects can have **nested modules and submodules**, similar to a tree structure.  
This makes it easy to organize complex applications like ERP systems.

### Example:

- **CLOUD ERP v2** (Project)
  - **app** (Main application folder)
    - **modules**
      - **accounts** (Module)
        - **documents/**
        - **schema/**
      - **product_management** (Module)
        - **documents/**
        - **schema/**
    - **clients**
      - **clients.yaml**
    - **js_scripts/**
    - **log/**
    - **process/**
    - **report_sys/**
    - **app_config/**
    - **system.yaml**
    - **server.crt**
    - **server.key**
    - **crudserver.exe**

> Similarly, you can have multiple projects under the `config/` folder, each with its own modules, clients, and configurations.

## Step 4: Getting Started Steps

1. **Choose a project folder** (e.g., `CLOUD ERP v2`)  
2. **Review `app_config/`** to ensure database and path configurations are correct.  
3. **Check `clients/clients.yaml`** to confirm client database connections.  
4. **Explore `modules/`** to understand the structure of documents and schemas.  
5. **Use `js_scripts/`** for any custom validation or processing requirements.  
6. **Run `crudserver.exe`** to initialize and start the server.  
7. **Monitor logs** in the `log/` folder for any errors or actions.  

> The folder structure is designed for **scalability**—you can add new projects, modules, or clients without disrupting existing setups.
