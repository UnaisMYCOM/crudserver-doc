## Clients Configuration

The `clients` section defines all the clients connected to a particular application on the CRUD Server.  
It includes database connections, enabled status, and the super user for each client.

```yaml
clients:
- client_id: client1
  dbsettings:
    db_type: mssql
    conn_str: sqlserver://unais:UU@devp@10.190.23.9:1433?database=CLOUDERP_DEVP_V3
  enabled: true
  super_user: admin
- client_id: "1"
  dbsettings:
    db_type: mssql
    conn_str: sqlserver://RPCM:9i286Fg7g4Zc33fjfryc@10.190.23.7:1433?database=CLOUDERP_LIVE_V2
  enabled: true
  super_user: admin
```


## Clients Explanation

### `client_id`
Unique identifier for the client. Can be numeric or string.

### `dbsettings`
Contains database connection information specific to that client.

- **`db_type`**: Type of database (e.g., `mssql`).  
- **`conn_str`**: Connection string used by CRUD Server to connect to the client database.

### `enabled`
Boolean flag that indicates whether this client is active on the server.

- `true` → Client can access the application.  
- `false` → Client is inactive and ignored.

### `super_user`
Username of the client’s super user. This user has full administrative access to the app.

## Clients Summary

- Each client can have a **unique database connection**.  
- CRUD Server dynamically reads this configuration to **connect clients to their respective databases**.  
- `enabled` allows you to **turn a client on or off** without deleting their configuration.  
- `super_user` defines **who can manage the app** for that client.
