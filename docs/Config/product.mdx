## Step 5: Inventory Section

Configure inventory-related settings:

| **Stock Type** | Defines how stock is handled. |

| **Inventory Control** | Enables or disables inventory tracking. |

## Step 6: More Details

Additional optional fields for better categorization and reporting:

| Field | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Brand ID** | Brand associated with the product. |
| **Product Category** | Logical product classification. |
| **Item Size** | Size information if applicable. |

## Step 7: Linked Production (Restaurant Use Case)

Linked Production allows multiple item variations to be connected to one main product.

### Example:

- **PIZZA** (Main Item)
  - Small Pizza
  - Medium Pizza
  - Large Pizza

### How It Works:
- In POS, only **one button (PIZZA)** is displayed.  
- When clicked, the customer or cashier selects the size (Small, Medium, Large).  
- Each size is linked internally for pricing, inventory, and reporting.

> ⚠️ **Tip:** Linked production is ideal for restaurant menus where size, flavor, or portion selection is required without cluttering the POS screen.
