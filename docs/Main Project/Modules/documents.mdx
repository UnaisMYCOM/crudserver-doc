## Applications Configuration

The `apps` section in CRUD Server defines the applications that are available on the server, along with their configuration files, default settings, and enabled status.

```yaml
apps:
  cloud_erp:
    app_settings: ./config/cloud_erp/app/app_config.yaml
    client_settings: ./config/cloud_erp/clients/clients.yaml
    default_app: true
    enabled: true
  backoffice:
    app_settings: ./config/smartinv_v1_8/app/app_config.yaml
    client_settings: ./config/smartinv_v1_8/clients/client_config.yaml
    default_app: false
    enabled: false
```

### Key Configuration Fields

#### `app_settings`
Path to the main application configuration YAML (e.g., `system.yaml` or `app_config.yaml`).  
This file defines:

- Modules  
- Databases  
- Logging  
- Scripts  
- Validations  

#### `client_settings`
Path to the client configuration YAML.  
This file contains:

- All client IDs  
- Database connections  
- Client-specific settings  

> **Note:** Each application can have multiple clients.

#### `default_app`
Boolean flag indicating if this is the **default app** to load when a client connects:

- `true` → This app loads automatically if no specific app is selected.  
- `false` → This app will not be loaded by default.

#### `enabled`
Boolean flag controlling whether the app is **active on the server**:

- `true` → App is available and can handle requests.  
- `false` → App is inactive and ignored by CRUD Server.

### Example Usage

When the CRUD Server starts, it reads the **apps section** to determine:

- Which apps are available  
- Which app should be loaded by default  

- **`cloud_erp`** is both **default** and **enabled**, so it will be the primary application served.  
- **`backoffice`** is configured but **disabled**, so the server will ignore it until `enabled` is set to `true`.

--**This configuration allows CRUD Server to host multiple apps on the same server while controlling which apps are active and which is the default for clients.
