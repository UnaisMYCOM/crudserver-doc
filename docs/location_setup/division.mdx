## Step 2: Create a Division

1. After creating a location, the **Division icon** will become active.  
2. Click the icon to open the **Division Tab**.  
3. Add the **default division code**:
   - If you created location code `001`, use **the same code (`001`)** for the division.
   - Leave **Price Group** empty for now (you will configure this in the next step).

### Why Divisions Are Important
Divisions are extremely useful for restaurants that operate **one physical location** but offer **multiple cuisines**, each with its own menu or product groups.  
Using Divisions, you can:

- Separate menus by cuisine  
- Manage reporting by concept  
- Control pricing and grouping efficiently  
- Run inventory per division if needed  

This makes multi-concept restaurant management smoother and more organized.
