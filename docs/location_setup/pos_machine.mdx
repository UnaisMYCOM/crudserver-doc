## Why POS Machine Setup Is Important

Every location can have one or more POS terminals. Each terminal must be defined in the ERP so the system can correctly recognize and authorize the device.

When configuring a POS machine, you can set:

- **Device ID**
- **POS Number / Terminal Number**
- **Assigned Location**
- **Additional attributes** (e.g., cashier count, device reference)

### What It Does

The POS Machine setup is used to **validate the terminal** when downloading master data to the POS application.  
If the POS machine details exist in the ERP, the download will proceed normally.  
If the POS machine is **not defined**, the system will:

❌ Reject the request  
❌ Show an error indicating the POS terminal is not registered

This ensures:

- Only authorized devices can download data  
- Security and data integrity are maintained  
- POS machines are correctly mapped to the right location
