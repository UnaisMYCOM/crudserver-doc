## Step 2: Configure Timings

When creating a timing entry, you can specify:

- **Location Code** – Select the location to which this timing applies.  
- **From Time** – Define the starting time.  
- **To Time** – Define the ending time.  
- **Description** – Optional notes about the timing (e.g., lunch hours, dinner shift, etc.).

## Why Timings Are Important

Timings help manage location-specific operations and ensure smooth integration across systems:

1. **Reservations** – If your ERP is integrated with a reservation system, timings define when tables are available for booking.  
2. **Online Ordering** – Timings control when the online ordering feature is active for a restaurant, automatically closing it outside the specified hours.  
3. **POS Operations** – Timings can be used to enforce working hours, shift schedules, or reporting periods for each location.

> ⚠️ **Tip:** Correct timing setup ensures smooth operations across POS, reservations, and online ordering, avoiding conflicts or errors during non-operational hours.
