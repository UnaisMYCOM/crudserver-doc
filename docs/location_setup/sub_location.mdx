## Why Sub-Locations Are Important

Sub-locations allow you to organize different operational areas under a single main location. They become especially helpful when the business has multiple internal departments or storage areas.

### Examples:
- A location may have a **Division** called *Retail*.  
- Under that Division, you can define multiple **Sub-Locations**, such as:
  - `Warehouse`
  - `Production`
  - `Display`
  - `Online Order Storage`

This helps differentiate stock movement and manage operations more accurately.

### For Small Businesses  
Smaller businesses can simply create **one default sub-location** (e.g., `001`).  
However, as the business grows, adding multiple sub-locations helps with:

- Better stock tracking  
- More accurate reporting  
- Clear separation between production, storage, and sales areas  
- Organized workflow for stock issuance and consumption  

> ⚠️ **Tip:** Proper sub-location setup ensures accurate stock movement, cleaner reports, and prevents inventory mismatches—especially useful for medium and large clients.
